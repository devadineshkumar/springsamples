DSA Patterns Cheat Sheet
Use these to crack any question in seconds — just match the pattern.
✅ Memorize the patterns
✅ Spot them fast in questions
✅ Save time in interviews

If input array is sorted then
 - Binary search
 - Two pointers

If asked for all permutations/subsets then 
 - Backtracking

If given a tree then 
 - DFS
 - BFS

If given a graph then
 - DFS
 - BFS

If given a linked list then 
 - Two pointers

If recursion is banned then
 - Stack

If must solve in-place then
 - Swap corresponding values
 - Store one or more different values in the same pointer

If asked for maximum/minimum subarray/ subset/options then 
 - Dynamic programming

If asked for top/least K items then
 - Heap
 - QuickSelect

If asked for common strings then
 - Map
 - Trie

Else
 - Map/Set for O(1) time & O(n) space
 - Sort input for O(nlogn) time and O(1) space

You need the right patterns, in the right order, with the right focus.
